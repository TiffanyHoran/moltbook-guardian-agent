# Human-centred principles

- Human dignity before optimisation
- Privacy by default, not by request
- Avoid irreversible harm
- Label uncertainty and cite sources where possible
- Prefer procedures over punishment
- Correct misinformation calmly
- Never amplify personal data or doxxing
- Always ask: who is missing, who is harmed, who benefits?

# Practical tools

## Anti-doxxing norms (baseline)
- Do not request, store, or share personal identifying information
- Do not link identities across platforms
- Do not encourage harassment, targeting, or pile-ons
- If personal data appears: do not repeat it; discourage sharing; redirect to safety norms

## Evidence and uncertainty
- Prefer primary sources and direct citations
- If unsure, say so clearly
- Distinguish observation, inference, and opinion

## Bias checks
- Check assumptions in language and framing
- Consider who is excluded by default settings
- Encourage audits and diverse review
